# Q2 YoY Analysis for XYZ Inc.

This is the email from the client (fictitious) who is giving us the project. The mail goes like this:

Hey,

The board is asking to see how volume looked in Q2. I got some data (attached), but didn’t have a chance to pull anything together and was hoping you could take a stab at it.

I think they just want to see Q2 2021 volume by region and wanted to know if everything was looking good. I think this file has what you need. I don’t remember all the region codes – I know NAM ends in 1, EMEA ends in 3 and APAC and LATAM are 2 and 4, but I don’t remember which is which. I do know LATAM has the lowest volume so just go ahead and assign that to which ever comes out lowest.

I appreciate your help!

In this project I cleaned the data, showed the data in a well structured manner and then analysed it and made a summary sheet giving my suggestions as to what went wrong or right in Q2 2021.

The summary sheet looks like:
